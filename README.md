# Interview Scheduler

This project was completed during Week 8 of Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp. It is a simple interview scheduler where new appointments between students and mentors can be booked, edited, and cancelled. It uses React, Webpack, Babel, Axios, and WebSockets. The app was tested with Storybook, Jest, and Cypress.
